## Install ##

### From Git checkout ###

Make sure you have Python 3 and [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) installed and in path.

If you want to create a virtual environment just to run this app:

    linux$ python3 -m venv ./python
    linux$ ./python/bin/activate

    windows> python -m venv ./python
    windows> ./python/Scripts/activate


After that do this to install dependencies:

    $ pip install setuptools wheel
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Then build the app:

    $ ./m

If you want to do something fancy read ./m or .\m.cmd.
