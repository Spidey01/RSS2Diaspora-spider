Make sure you have Python 3 and [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) installed and in path.

If you want to create a virtual environment just to run this app:

    $ python -m venv ./python
    $ ./python/Scripts/activate
    $ pip install setuptools wheel

Then build the app:

    $ ./m

If you want to do something fancy read ./m or .\m.cmd.
